# TUNL - Claude Code Instructions

## Working style

- Just do the task. Don't ask for confirmation before reading files, running searches, or making straightforward edits.
- Don't ask clarifying questions if the intent is clear from context - make a reasonable choice and do it.
- Only ask when something is genuinely ambiguous AND the wrong choice would be hard to undo.

## What is this

TUNL is a single-file HTML5 Canvas hold-to-thrust cave flyer game.
Single file: `tunl.html` - no libraries, no build step.
Open in a browser to play.

**Orientation: landscape only.** The iOS app (`Info.plist`) locks to `LandscapeLeft + LandscapeRight`. Never change this to portrait.

## How to play

- **HOLD** (tap/click/Space/ArrowUp) = thrust upward
- **RELEASE** = gravity pulls you down
- Collect gold coins to temporarily widen the corridor
- Avoid stalactites and tunnel walls
- Score = distance scrolled / 60

## Game Architecture

One JS class-free script, state machine with three phases: `'title'` | `'play'` | `'dead'`

### Canvas size
`W = min(window.innerWidth, 600)`, `H = min(window.innerHeight, 600)` - capped at 600x600 for consistent difficulty regardless of screen size.

### Physics constants
```javascript
const GRAVITY = 950;   // px/s² downward
const THRUST  = 1900;  // px/s² upward when holding (net: 950 up)
const MAX_VY  = 680;   // terminal velocity cap
```
The thrust/gravity balance is symmetric: net upward force = net downward force = 950 px/s².
Do NOT change this ratio - it's the core feel of the game.

### Player
```javascript
const PX = W * 0.22;   // fixed horizontal position on screen
const PR = W * 0.018;  // radius (≈10.8px at W=600)
```

### Procedural tunnel
Two overlapping sin waves, amplitude and frequency scale with difficulty (`_prog`).
`_prog = Math.min(scrollX / 10000, 1)` - reaches max difficulty at 10000 world px (~score 167).

```javascript
_halfGap = lerp(H * 0.27,  H * 0.092, _prog);  // 162→55px half-gap (rendering/collision)
// Note: boundsBase() for placement uses halfGapAt() = lerp(H*0.21, H*0.092, ...) = 126→55px
// The rendering corridor is wider than the placement bounds early on, giving extra wall margin.
_wA1     = lerp(H * 0.07,  H * 0.12,  _prog);   // wave amplitude 1
_wA2     = lerp(H * 0.035, H * 0.055, _prog);   // wave amplitude 2
_wF1     = lerp(0.0025,    0.0048,    _prog);    // wave frequency 1
_wF2     = lerp(0.0060,    0.0115,    _prog);    // wave frequency 2
```

Two bounds functions:
- `boundsAt(wx)` - includes coin bonus - used for rendering AND collision
- `boundsBase(wx)` - base only (no bonus) - used only for placing coins safely

### Stalactites
Triangle-shaped obstacles from top or bottom wall. Accurate triangle-circle collision (not AABB).
Paired stalactites (chicane from both sides) appear after `_prog > 0.40` with 24% chance.

### Coin system
Coins collect into `gapBonus` (extra halfGap px, capped, decays over time):
```javascript
const GAP_PER_COIN  = H * 0.025;   // +15px halfGap per coin
const GAP_BONUS_MAX = H * 0.06;    // cap: max ~36px halfGap bonus (72px full gap)
const GAP_DECAY     = H * 0.010;   // ~2.5s per coin at constant decay rate
```
Wall glow shifts purple → cyan when bonus is active. Gold bar at bottom shows remaining bonus.

### Difficulty scaling functions

Two-phase difficulty system:
- `_prog  = Math.min(scrollX / 10000, 1)` - main ramp, 0→1 over first 10000px (~score 167)
- `_prog2 = Math.min(Math.max(scrollX - 10000, 0) / 40000, 1)` - inferno, 0→1 from 10000→50000px

```javascript
scrollSpd()    // 200 → 560 → 700 px/s
stalSpacing()  // 260 → 100 → 70 px between stalactites
stalLenFrac()  // 0.36 → 0.50 → 0.60 fraction of halfGap (also the max cap)
coinSpacing()  // 600 → 320 → 230 px between coins
chicaneProb    // 0 → 0.24 → 0.42 probability of paired stalactites
```

At full inferno (scrollX=50000, dist score ~833): chicane min passable gap = 44px (player dia=21.6px).
With gapBonus maxed (+36px): effective chicane gap ~116px - coins remain crucial at high difficulty.

### Addictive systems

**Score formula**: `score = Math.floor(scrollX / 60) + bonusScore`
`bonusScore` accumulates from coin collection and near-miss bonuses; resets each run.

**Milestone moments**: Triggers at 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250... (steps of 25 below 100, then 50).
Shows big floating text + gold particle burst + ascending chord. `milestoneFlash` decays over ~0.6s.

**Near-miss bonus**: +1 bonusScore when wall clearance < `PR * 2.0` (within 2 player radii of wall).
1.5s cooldown prevents spam. Shows "+CLOSE" notif + quick ascending ping sfx.

**Coin combo multiplier**: Coins collected within 2s of each other build a streak.
Score pts = `coinCombo * 3` (so x1=+3, x2=+6, x3=+9...). Shows "x2", "x3" notif above gold coin notif.
Blue/red coins join the streak but their notif doesn't change (power-up is the reward).

**Death screen context**: Shows "+X vs last" / "-X vs last" after the second run. Uses `prevRunScore` (run before the current one). Score number glows gold when within 5 of personal best.

## Key design decisions (do not revert)

- **Coin bonus is intentionally modest**: +15px per coin, max +36px halfGap. At max difficulty the full corridor is 110px; one coin adds ~27%, max bonus adds ~65%. This is helpful but not a free pass.
- **boundsBase for coin placement**: Coins placed ignoring current bonus so they're always reachable even without a bonus. Never use `boundsAt()` for coin placement.
- **Triangle-circle collision**: Stalactites use proper geometric collision matching the visual triangle, not AABB. Changing to AABB would make invisible collisions at the edges.
- **No em dashes (-)** anywhere in code, comments, or UI text. Use hyphen-minus (-) instead.

## Possible future features

- Power-ups beyond coins (shield, slow-time)
- Animated background parallax layers
- High score persistence via localStorage
- Multiple difficulty modes
- Mobile fullscreen on iOS/Android
- Sound effects (Web Audio API, no external files)
- Level theming (lava/ice/neon)
